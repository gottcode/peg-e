"Peg-E is a peg solitaire game in which you jump over pieces in order to "
"remove them from the board, ultimately trying to eliminate all but one. The "
"boards are randomly generated, with 100 levels of difficulty. The game auto-"
"saves, and has undo-redo capability. Pieces can move horizontally, "
"vertically, and diagonally."
